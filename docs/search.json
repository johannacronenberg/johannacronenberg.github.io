After finishing my philological and linguistic undergraduate studies, I moved to Munich to study at the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing. I was awarded my PhD in phonetics as part of the ERC project InterAccent supervised by Prof. Jonathan Harrington in 2023. Now I am a Post Doc at the Université Paris Cité where I am working with Prof. Ioana Chitoran on vowel sequences in Romance languages as part of the project DIPVAR.\nI am interested in all facets of sound change: its historical, phonological, and phonetic origins and the mechanisms that cause its spread. In my research I apply functional analyses, often on large-scale acoustic data, and computational modelling techniques to gain insights into specific sound changes. Most recently, I have worked on the change from pre- to post-aspirated stops in Andalusian Spanish and on the evolution of diphthongs in Romance languages.\n\n\nEducation\n\nPhD in Phonetics and Speech Processing, 2023University of Munich\nM.A. Phonetics and Speech Processing, 2018University of Munich\nB.A. Language and Communication, 2016University of Marburg\nB.A. Romance Philology, 2016University of Marburg & University of Madrid"
